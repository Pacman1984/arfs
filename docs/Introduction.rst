Introduction
============

The ARFS package provides 3 fast methods for performing all relevant feature selection. 
It also provides a new implementation of Uber's MRmr scheme and basic feature selection methods 
(filtering out zero variance, too many missing values, etc.) and some utilities for preprocessing the data.

In the documentation, you'll find several notebooks describing those methods and how to apply them to different tasks.
